# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?

After day 2 of working on Ruby methods, I am starting to get a hang of working with different methods. I am also trying to use more technical terms such as calling () parameters instead of paranthesis. Or not calling things "thingies."

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?

I am confident enough to just write the methods in code and printing them on Ruby. The worse that will happen is an error will come up, but the great thing about Replit and Terminal is it will usually tell you what was wrong with the code and how to fix it. I find it satisfying when I can finally get a successful output after a few errors.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)

The only question I had today was, "Do we have to memorize all methods?" but at the end of the live session, this was answered by Kaitlyn. She stated that developers won't ever know ever method that exists, but there are resources to reference to such as ruby-doc.org
